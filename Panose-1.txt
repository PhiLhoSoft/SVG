Meaning of the Panose-1 Digits

http://www.panose.com/printer/pan1.asp

The PANOSE Typeface Matching System is used to classify a
Latin text, display, handwritten, or decorative face or symbolic fonts.

PANOSE is a classification system for visual attributes of type only.
There is no information contained within a PANOSE Classification Number
that pertains to the character widths, spacing metrics, or advance widths.

PANOSE Classification Numbers used in static outline fonts consist of ten digits.
The first digit defines what type of font is being classified (Latin Text, Symbolic,
Japanese Decorative, etc.) and the following 9 provide classification within that type.
Thus digits 2 through 10 change meaning depending on what the first digit is.
There is always a digit that expresses weight, one that expresses aspect ratio,
and a monospace / proportional flag but their position may change depending on the type of font.
The order of the digits is roughly the order in which they are useful
in maximizing the separation of closely related faces.
Thus the position of digits expressing the same quantity (for example aspect ratio)
will not always be the same (it is digit 4 in Latin Text and 5 in Latin Handwritten).

The reader will notice that the value 0 and 1 are defined as Any and No Fit for every digit
in the PANOSE system. These have specific meanings to the mapper.
0 means match that digit with any available digit.
This allows the mapper to handle distortable typefaces such as multiple master fonts in which,
for example, weights may be variable or serifs may change.
1 means that the item being classified does not fit within the present system,
either because no work was done on that family of faces,
for example an Arabic cursive, or because within the classification scheme
there is nothing that fits the particular case that is being classified,
for example a completely new shape of serif in a Latin Text font
that does not fit the existing design space.

Serif Style / Variant
(Latin Text / Latin Decorative)

The most sophisticated digit in the PANOSE classification system is the Serif Style digit.
This digit describes the appearance of the serifs used in a font design and
groups them into one of fourteen general categories.
Serif and sans serif faces are classified within this digit,
though less description is given to the stem terminators of sans serif styles.

9 - Exaggerated
10 - Triangle
11 - Normal Sans
12 - Obtuse Sans
13 - Perpendicular Sans
14 - Flared
15 - Rounded
-- For Decorative fonts
16 - Script


Weight
(Latin Text, Latin Hand Written, Latin Decorative, Latin Symbol)

The Weight digit classifies the appearance of a fonts’ stroke thickness in relation to its height.
This is expressed as a ratio taken from two measurements on the uppercase E glyph and
the Upper H used before.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit -- Sole value for Latin Symbol
2 - Very Light [100]
3 - Light [200]
4 - Thin [300]
5 - Book [400] same as CSS1 'normal'
6 - Medium [500]
7 - Demi [600]
8 - Bold [700] same as CSS1 'bold'
9 - Heavy [800]
10 - Black [900]
11 - Extra Black [900] force mapping to CSS1 100-900 scale


Proportion
(Latin Text)

Three different proportion schemes are considered:
normal, distorted, and monospaced.
Within these different schemes several alternatives are listed.
There are three variants on proportion that fall under the general normal class.
These are Old Style, Modern, and Even Width.
And there are four variants of distorted:
Extended, Condensed, Very Extended, and Very Condensed.

0 - Any
1 - No fit
2 - Old Style
3 - Modern
4 - Even Width
5 - Extended
6 - Condensed
7 - Very Extended
8 - Very Condensed
9 - Monospaced


Contrast
(Latin Text, Latin Hand Written, Latin Decorative, Latin Symbol)

The Contrast digit describes the ratio between the thickest point on the stroke of the letter O
and the narrowest point on the letter O.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit -- Sole value for Latin Symbol
2 - None
3 - Very Low
4 - Low
5 - Medium Low
6 - Medium
7 - Medium High
8 - High
9 - Very High


Stroke Variation
(Latin Text)

The contrast classification of a given font specifies the relationship between
the thicknesses of the thin stems and the wide stems.
The Stroke Variation category further details the contrast trait by describing
the kind of transition that occurs as the stem thickness changes on rounded glyph shapes.
Two attributes of transition are classified, the angle of the transition and
the speed of the transition.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit
2 - No Variation
3 - Gradual/Diagonal
4 - Gradual/Transitional
5 - Gradual/Vertical
6 - Gradual/Horizontal
7 - Rapid/Vertical
8 - Rapid/Horizontal
9 - Instant/Vertical
10 - Instant/Horizontal


Arm Style
(Latin Text)

The Arm Style category classifies two attributes of a glyph design:
special treatment of diagonal stems and termination of open rounded letterforms.
Most font designs will classify as Straight Arms/Wedge or Straight Arms/Single Serif.
The uppercase A and C are used extensively for this classification.
Other letters which determine the Arm Style setting are uppercase G, M, S, V, W, and Y.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit
2 - Straight Arms/Horizontal
3 - Straight Arms/Wedge
4 - Straight Arms/Vertical
5 - Straight Arms/Single Serif
6 - Straight Arms/Double Serif
7 - Non-Straight/Horizontal
8 - Non-Straight/Wedge
9 - Non-Straight/Vertical
10 - Non-Straight/Single Serif
11 - Non-Straight/Double Serif


Letterform
(Latin Text)

Most sophisticated typeface designs alter the roundness of the character shapes
in order to give the font a distinctive appearance or balance of white-space.
This roundness is classified in the Letterform category.
In addition to the glyph roundness, the predominant skewing of the character forms
is also recorded and used to isolate oblique characters.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit
2 - Normal/Contact
3 - Normal/Weighted
4 - Normal/Boxed
5 - Normal/Flattened
6 - Normal/Rounded
7 - Normal/Off Center
8 - Normal/Square
9 - Oblique/Contact
10 - Oblique/Weighted
11 - Oblique/Boxed
12 - Oblique/Flattened
13 - Oblique/Rounded
14 - Oblique/Off Center
5 - Oblique/Square


Midline
(Latin Text)

This analyzes two traits, the placement of the midline across the uppercase characters and
the treatment of diagonal stem apexes.
The midline classification falls into one of four sub-categories:
Standard, High, Constant, and Low.
The apex treatment has only three variants: Trimmed, Pointed, and Serifed.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit
2 - Standard/Trimmed
3 - Standard/Pointed
4 - Standard/Serifed
5 - High/Trimmed
6 - High/Pointed
7 - High/Serifed
8 - Constant/Trimmed
9 - Constant/Pointed
10 - Constant/Serifed
11 - Low/Trimmed
12 - Low/Pointed
13 - Low/Serifed


X-height
(Latin Text)

Two different traits are represented in the X-height digit:
the treatment of uppercase glyphs with diacritical marks and
the relative size of the lowercase characters.
Note: If a face does not have lowercase glyphs, it is a Decorative.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit
2 - Constant/Small
3 - Constant/Standard
4 - Constant/Large
5 - Ducking/Small
6 - Ducking/Standard
7 - Ducking/Large


Tool kind
(Latin Hand Written)

Kind of implement predominately used to create character forms.
A flat nib is an inflexible rectangular nib, like a standard calligraphy pen nib,
whose line width is dependent only on the angle of the edge of the nib
with respect to the line.
A pressure point is a flexible point, like those used to do copperplate lettering,
which spreads when pressed down upon and forms a wider line.
Engraved cursive lettering has many of the characteristics of pressure point,
but it also has fine added lines that could only be made with a graver.
Ball is the type of line produced by a ball point pen or similar round nib.
It has a single line weight and convexly rounded stem caps.
Brush means a rectangular brush.
It looks superficially like a flat nib but has more fluid stroke endings and
gentle swellings along strokes as a brush would make responding to pressure.
Rough looks like the lettering was done with a rough edged nib or
a nib that was too dry or on a rough surface.
It is characterized by unpredictable starts and stops within the letter.
Felt tip or brush tip looks somewhat like the Ball nib but has the characteristic swellings
within the line of a more flexible instrument.
Wild brush looks hastily or sloppily done with drips and
splatters of ink in unpredictable places.
The difference between this and a decorative lettering is often minimal and
based on readability and whether there is a full family of letter forms
(book, italic, bold, and bold italic).

0 - Any
1 - No Fit
2 - Flat Nib
3 - Pressure Point
4 - Engraved
5 - Ball (Round Cap)
6 - Brush
7 - Rough
8 - Felt Pen/Brush Tip
9 - Wild Brush - Drips a lot


Spacing
(Latin Hand Written, Latin Symbol)

This digit allows monospaced and proportional fonts to be distinguished.

0 - Any
1 - No fit
2 - Proportional Spaced
3 - Monospaced


Aspect Ratio
(Latin Hand Written, Latin Symbol)

This is the ratio between the width and the height of the face measured using the Upper O.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit -- Sole value for Latin Symbol
2 - Very Condensed
3 - Condensed
4 - Normal
5 - Expanded
6 - Very Expanded


Topology
(Latin Hand Written)

The topology classification is a two step process.
First the cursive face is separated into Roman, Cursive, and Blackletter
based on the letterforms and then the connections between the letters are classified.
Roman means that the letterforms are still similar to upright faces,
but have been slanted to from a cursive.
These faces tend to look like hand printing.
Cursive means that some characters, such as the lower a and g,
have been modified to look more like hand written forms.
These faces tend to look like flowing script handwriting.
Blackletter implies that there have been major modifications to many of the letterforms.
These faces tend to be very black and condensed and often feel angry or aggressive.
Disconnected means that each letter is distinct and there is no connection from one to the next.
Trailing means that the trailing serifs of the letters, usually along the baseline,
have been extended so that they may overlap with the following character.
Connected means that the letterforms have been constructed
so that they connect to their neighbors explicitly.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit
2 - Roman Disconnected
3 - Roman Trailing
4 - Roman Connected
5 - Cursive Disconnected
6 - Cursive Trailing
7 - Cursive Connected
8 - Blackletter Disconnected
9 - Blackletter Trailing
10 - Blackletter Connected


Form
(Latin Hand Written)

The form digit tries to measure the general look of the face.
It combines two measures, the slope of the verticals and
the wrap of the tails of connecting strokes, such as the curving stroke in the Upper D.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit
2 - Upright / No Wrapping
3 - Upright / Some Wrapping
4 - Upright / More Wrapping
5 - Upright / Extreme Wrapping
6 - Oblique / No Wrapping
7 - Oblique / Some Wrapping
8 - Oblique / More Wrapping
9 - Oblique / Extreme Wrapping
10 - Exaggerated / No Wrapping
11 - Exaggerated / Some Wrapping
12 - Exaggerated / More Wrapping
13 - Exaggerated / Extreme Wrapping


Finials
(Latin Hand Written)

Finials combines the treatment of the ends of characters,
like the foot at the right bottom of the upper a,
with the treatment of the ascenders of the lower case characters.
If there is no extra treatment of the stroke end,
other than what the lettering nib would naturally do, that is a none.
If has been chopped off abruptly, that is a sharp,
if it has been tapered to a narrower width than the nib would naturally create, that is a tapered.
If it has been made bulbous that is rounded.
The classification of ascenders into no loops, open loops and closed loops is usually unambiguous.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit
2 - None / No loops
3 - None / Closed loops
4 - None / Open loops
5 - Sharp / No loops
6 - Sharp / Closed loops
7 - Sharp / Open loops
8 - Tapered / No loops
9 - Tapered / Closed loops
10 - Tapered / Open loops
11 - Round / No loops
12 - Round / Closed loops
13 - Round / Open loops


X-Ascent
(Latin Hand Written)

The X-ascent digit measures the relative size of the lowercase characters.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit
2 - Very Low
3 - Low
4 - Medium
5 - High
6 - Very High


Class
(Latin Decorative)

The class is the general look and feel of the face.
Faces should be classed with as low a digit as is reasonable.
Derivative is Decoratives that are closely derived standard text forms.
Non-standard Topology has unusual forms for entire letters but still uses standard stems.
Non-standard Elements has usual forms but unusual treatments of parts of them,
such as serifs or ascenders.
Non-standard Aspect has the usual letter forms but unusual proportions
such as very high or very low waists.
Initials is for faces that only have majuscule characters, no minuscules.
Often these characters are highly ornamented.
Cartoon faces have the entire letter made up of a single picture
that form the outline of the character.
Picture Stem faces have each stem made up of a picture or pictures and
the letters made from groups of these elements.
Ornamented faces have additional flourishes and details added to the character.
Text and Background faces have the characters displayed as the absence of pattern
on a patterned background.
In Collage faces the characters are made up of repeating nonstandard elements.
In Montage faces the characters are made up of nonrepeating nonstandard elements.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit
2 - Derivative
3 - Non-standard Topology
4 - Non-standard Elements
5 -  Non-standard Aspect

9 - Ornamented
10 - Text and Background
11 - Collage
12 - Montage


Treatment
(Latin Decorative)

This digit describes the treatment of the total letters.
For the sake of this digit it is assumed that the character actually consists of two parts,
the outline and the fill within the outline.
None is the standard solid fill that is used in text fonts.
White or No Fill means that just the outline of the character shows.
Pattern fill indicates that all the letters are filled with the same repeating pattern.
Complex fill indicates that different letters are filled with different repeating patterns.
Shaped fill indicates that the fill patterns are recognizable forms from other contexts.
Drawn or Distressed fill indicates that the fill of each letter is unique and individual.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit
2 - None - Standard Solid Fill
3 - White / No Fill
4 - Patterned Fill
5 - Complex Fill
6 - Shaped Fill
7 - Drawn / Distressed


Lining
(Latin Decorative)

Lining refers to how the outlines of the characters are handled.
None is just a simple line. Inline is a line that is shaded on the inside.
Outline is shaded on the outside.
Often in the outline case, the letter is indicated as white space on the background pattern.
Engraved is used to indicate that the outlines have been multiplied
(not necessarily the same number of times on all edges).
Shadow indicates there is an offset copy of the outline to one side simulating a shadow.
Relief has this offset copy attached and perspective rules
applied to make the letter look three dimensional.
Backdrop is for letters that look to be floating above a background.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit
2 - None
3 - Inline
4 - Outline
5 - Engraved (Multiple Lines)
6 - Shadow
7 - Relief
8 - Backdrop


Topology
(Latin Decorative)

This digit attempts to encapsulate unusual characteristics inherent in the topology of the font.
Sometimes faces have more than one of these characteristics and
the classifier must make a judgment call.
Remember that the reason for PANOSE numbers is to make distinctions,
so choose what seems to best characterize the unique features of the font.
Standard is for fonts that have normal looking character topologies.
Square means that the font has an exaggerated square or angular character.
Multiple segments reflect fonts where the strokes have been broken into multiple pieces.
Deco refers to Art Deco style faces where the midlines are very high or low.
Often characters like the E, M, and S have changed their forms markedly in these faces.
Uneven Weighting implies that different elements within the font
have consistently different weights.
For example vertical stems are consistently very heavy relative to horizontal stems.
Diverse Arms mean that the arms on different characters are dissimilar.
Diverse Forms means that characters that would be similar in a text face,
such as the b, d, g, q, are dissimilar. Lombardic Forms have exaggerated, manipulated stems.
Upper Case in Lower Case means that there are variant caps or small caps
in the positions in the character map that would usually be occupied by lower case forms.
Implied Topology means that there are pieces of the characters missing,
such as ascending diagonals, which the reader’s eye must interpolate.
Horseshoe E and A means that even the most angular letters, like the E and A,
have been rounded. Cursive means that the letter forms follow cursive models.
Blackletter means that the letter forms follow German fraktur models.
Swash Variance means that there are multiple variant swash capitals.

12 - Horseshoe E and A
13 - Cursive
14 - Blackletter
15 - Swash Variance


Range of Characters
(Latin Decorative)

This digit quantifies the range of characters available in the decorative font.
Extended Collection means that the full font range is available.
Literals means that only the alphanumerics are available.
No Lower Case means just that.
Small Caps means that only small caps are available in the font, no upper or lower case.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit
2 - Extended Collection
3 - Litterals
4 - No Lower Case
5 - Small Caps


Kind
(Latin Symbol)

Montages are symbol sets in which no single type of symbol is more that 50% of the total set.
Picture sets are made up of pictures like hands, feet, religious symbols, hardware, flowers,
buildings, clocks etc.
Shape sets are made up of abstract shapes like arrows, boxes, squares, dots, stars, etc.
Scientific sets contains specialized scientific symbols like math Greek letters,
differential segments, etc.
Music sets contain notes and specialized music symbols like clefs, sharps, flats, trills, etc.
Expert sets are extensions to text fonts containing groups of specialized ligatures,
groups of small caps, etc.
Pattern sets contain line fill symbols, textures, etc.
Boarder sets contain various kinds of simple or fancy boarder sections and corners.
Icon sets contain block illustrations, symbolic shapes, etc.
Logo sets contain copyrighted logos, registered artwork, etc.
Industry Specific sets contain symbols specific to different fields, like medicine, law,
engineering, etc.

Aspect ratio of character #
(Latin Symbol)

The Aspect Ratio is taken to be the height of character # (94, 119, 157, 163, 211)
divided by the black width.
Character 94 was chosen to be in the Lower ASCII range and thus usually used.
Character 119 was chosen to be in the Lower ASCII range and thus usually used.
Character 157 was chosen because it lies in the printer control area of the
standard ASCII table and is thus often not used.
Character 163 was chosen to be in the Upper ASCII (8-bit ASCII) range and
thus will likely be used only in an extended symbol set.
Character 211 was chosen to be in the Upper ASCII (8-bit ASCII) range and
thus will likely be used only in an extended symbol set.

0 - Any
1 - No Fit
2 - No Width
3 - Exceptionally Wide
4 - Super Wide
5 - Very Wide
6 - Wide
7 - Normal
8 - Narrow
9 - Very Narrow
