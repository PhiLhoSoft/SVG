<body>
This is a mix of HTML (this line) and SVG (the image below).<br />
<object data="Tests3.svg" width="640" height="480" type="image/svg+xml">
<!-- embed shouldn't be necessary, but is here for old Netscape Nav. support -->
<embed name="Tests" src="Tests3.svg" width="640" height="480" type="image/svg+xml" />
<noembed>If you see this text instead of an image,
you should go fetch a good SVG viewer...</noembed>
</object><br />
It is nice, isn't it?
<!--
Note: you can use only the <embed> tag:
It is Netscape specific, and it is not a regular HTML tag,
that's why I don't use it alone.
<object> is the way to go, but it is not understood by
Netscape Communicator 4.x...
while <embed> is actually understood by Internet Explorer.
The way I use these tags: If <object> is understood, it is used,
and the alternative code given up to the </object> tag is ignored.
Otherwise, the tag is ignored and <embed> is used instead.
If not understood (some alternate browser? or no plug-in),
the <noembed> code is displayed instead, giving a warning.
You can even put a static image of the SVG in the <noembed> zone.
