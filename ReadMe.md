# SVG

Over the years, I created various experimentations with SVG, mostly from a time where we needed an Adobe plugin in the browsers to view these files...

Most of these files are hand-edited.<br>
Some are derivated from code found on Internet.<br>
I also have some Lua scripts manipulating SVG.

The 3rdParty folder contains samples I collected.

The Inkscape folder contains drawings I made with this software.
